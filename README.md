# What is MÂ³?
This is a modpack created with the intention of not only keeping the pack on the lighter side, but also having something for everyone. Whether you're a builder, an explorer, into magic or tech, we hope you find something that you like in this pack.

This pack is made using packwiz, which you can find at https://github.com/packwiz/packwiz.

# Building the pack
If you're impatient enough and can't wait for a proper release, here are some rough intructions on how you can build the pack:
- Install packwiz
- Download the contents of the repository
- Unzip said contents
- Run `packwiz curseforge export` in the pack's directory, it will output a .zip file
- Import that zip file into MultiMC, GDLauncher, the Curseforge launcher, etc.
